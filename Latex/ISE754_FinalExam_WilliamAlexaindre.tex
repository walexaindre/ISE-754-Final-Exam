All of the code and calculations are uploaded to my GitHub repository static web site: 

\href{https://walexaindre.github.io/ISE-754-Final-Exam/}{https://walexaindre.github.io/ISE-754-Final-Exam/}, with that link there is no necesity to compile anything. You can explore it directly in the web browser.

The following link is the Github repository: \href{https://github.com/walexaindre/ISE-754-Final-Exam}{https://github.com/walexaindre/ISE-754-Final-Exam} that contains all of the code, instructions on how to compile and more.

% question 5
\begin{question}{5}
For our problem we have $L=1500 \text{ Du}$, Travel costs of $3$ Mu/Du and cargo transportation needs per time unit as shown below: 

$$\delta(d)=\begin{cases}
    5,& \text{if } 0\leq d \leq 500\\
    1,& \text{if } 500< d < 1000\\
    5,& \text{if } 1000\leq d \leq 1500
\end{cases}$$
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
    $$CummulativeDemand(d) = CD(d) = \begin{cases}
    5d,& \text{if } 0\leq d \leq 500\\
    2500 + (d-500),& \text{if } 500< d < 1000\\
    3000 + 5(d-1000),& \text{if } 1000\leq d \leq 1500
    \end{cases}$$


    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.3cm]
        \item[A.] The approach that I will use for this part is solve use the integrals in the formulation to get the answer.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For this case, the optimal location is given by:
            $$\displaystyle d^* = \frac{\int_{a}^{b} CD(x) \mathrm{d}x + CD(a)\cdot a - CD(b)\cdot b }{CD(a)-CD(b)}$$ which is obtained by setting the areas on both sides of the $d^*$ equal to each other. For our particular problem:

            $$\displaystyle d^* = \frac{\int_{0}^{1500} CD(x) \mathrm{d}x + CD(0)\cdot 0 - CD(1500)\cdot 1500 }{CD(0)-CD(1500)}$$
            $${\displaystyle d^* = \frac{4,125,000+0 - 8,250,000}{0-5500} = 750}$$ 
            $$\boxed{\displaystyle d^* = 750}$$ The best location for the terminal ($n=1$) is at $750$ Du.
            \item For the case $n=2$ and $n=3$ I used the bisection method to find the optimal locations numerically. Please look in the next photos.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{solution}
