## You don't need to compile this project. You could just see the web version of it. Everything is as interactive as possible and you dont need to do any extra steps.

# Planning in using this project?

* Node.js is a must to execute the code.

# How was this made?

* By employing Svelte, Typescript, Vite and Math. The idea here is to show in a somewhat interactive presentation where you can play and see what happens.

# How to navigate 

* To navigate this project in the web you must choose the question and the subtopic using the top tabs

* If you want to explore the source code. I partitioned it by question and by concept or similarity

# Compilation steps

* Install Node.js in your system. If you have *Homebrew*, you can simply execute 

```bash
brew install node@24
brew install pnpm
```

After this please access the folder where the project is stored and execute

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

With this you should be able to connect run the webserver and play with the code. If you do not want to install or execute anything, please access this link where the files are served.
